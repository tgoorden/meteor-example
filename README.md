# 'Best practices' Meteor example

This Meteor shows a number of techniques we use for production-level Meteor applications. They're based on our experiences building several Meteor projects.

The _style_ used is:

* As concise as possible without losing readability. That's why you'll find Coffeescript, Jade, etc.
* DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself)
* Use as much as possible from the included Meteor packages and only when there is no good alternative, use Atmosphere packages. Only proven packages are included.
* Proper scoping/state design.
